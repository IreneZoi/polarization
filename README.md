This is the basic code has to files.
As the name suggests, after opening the root files:
- Plot gen level and jet level variables, with a focus on cos theta for polarization studied
-  Apply some selections and plot variables using coffea and create an example h5 file with some variables for the next NN studies

Tested on https://coffea.casa/ with default el9 python 3 kernel.
